Overview


This project continues the development of a Real-Time Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) System for aging infrastructure, utilizing IoT, AI, and machine learning. The system continuously monitors key structural parameters, providing early failure predictions and maintenance alerts to ensure safety and durability.

Key Features

Data Collection: IoT sensors for real-time monitoring.

Machine Learning Analysis: Anomaly detection and failure prediction.

Dashboard: Cloud-based platform for live tracking and alerts.
Financial Equation

The financial model for the SHM system is based on the following profit equation:

Profit
=
Revenue
−
(
Cost of Sensors
+
Operational Costs
)
Profit=Revenue−(Cost of Sensors+Operational Costs)
This equation considers revenue generated from hardware, software, and subscriptions, minus the combined cost of sensors and ongoing operational expenses.
